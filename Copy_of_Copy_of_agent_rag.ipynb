        "# Agentic RAG: turbocharge your RAG with query reformulation and self-query! üöÄ\n",

        "> This tutorial is advanced. You should have notions from [this other cookbook](advanced_rag) first!\n",
        "\n",
        "> Reminder: Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) is ‚Äúusing an LLM to answer a user query, but basing the answer on information retrieved from a knowledge base‚Äù. It has many advantages over using a vanilla or fine-tuned LLM: to name a few, it allows to ground the answer on true facts and reduce confabulations, it allows to provide the LLM with domain-specific knowledge, and it allows fine-grained control of access to information from the knowledge base.\n",
        "\n",
        "But vanilla RAG has limitations, most importantly these two:\n",
        "- It **performs only one retrieval step**: if the results are bad, the generation in turn will be bad.\n",
        "- __Semantic similarity is computed with the *user query* as a reference__, which might be suboptimal: for instance, the user query will often be a question and the document containing the true answer will be in affirmative voice, so its similarity score will be downgraded compared to other source documents in the interrogative form, leading to a risk of missing the relevant information.\n",
        "\n",
        "But we can alleviate these problems by making a **RAG agent: very simply, an agent armed with a retriever tool!**\n",
        "\n",
        "This agent will: ‚úÖ Formulate the query itself and ‚úÖ Critique to re-retrieve if needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "So it should naively recover some advanced RAG techniques!\n",
        "- Instead of directly using the user query as the reference in semantic search, the agent formulates itself a reference sentence that can be closer to the targeted documents, as in [HyDE](https://huggingface.co/papers/2212.10496)\n",
        "- The agent can the generated snippets and re-retrieve if needed, as in [Self-Query](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/evaluation/RetryQuery/)\n",

In this section, we\\'ll show how you can load your model from the hub and use it for inference.===== Document 4 =====\\n--push_to_hub\\n```===== Document 5 =====\\n. The second way to upload a model, though, is to call model.push_to_hub(). So this is more of a once-off method - it\\'s not called regularly during training. You can just call this manually whenever you want to upload a model to the hub. So we recommend running this after the end of training, just to make sure that you have a commit message just to guarantee that this was the final version of the model at the end of training. And it just makes sure that you\\'re working with the definitive end-of-training model and not accidentally using a model that\\'s from a checkpoint somewhere along the way===== Document 6 =====\\nFinally, if you want, you can push your model up to the hub. Here, we\\'ll push it up if you specified `push_to_hub=True` in the training configuration. Note that in order to push to hub, you\\'ll have to have git-lfs installed and be logged into your Hugging Face account (which can be done via `huggingface-cli login`).\\n\\n```python\\nkwargs = {\\n    \"finetuned_from\": model.config._name_or_path,\\n    \"tasks\": \"image-classification\",\\n    \"dataset\": \\'beans\\',\\n    \"tags\": [\\'image-classification\\'],\\n}'}\n",
